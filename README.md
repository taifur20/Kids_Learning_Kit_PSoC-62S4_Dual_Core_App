# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU & CAPSENSE&trade; Based Dual-Core Project

This code example demonstrates how to create a Dual-core firmware design using ModusToolbox 3.0. This project utilize CAPSENSE&trade; design using on the CM0+ core of PSoC&trade; 6 MCU devices. The CM4 core is used to drive an LCD display and response on the messages receives from CM0+. This code example features a 5-segment CAPSENSE&trade; slider and two CAPSENSE&trade; buttons. Button 0 (**BTN0**) and button 1 (**BTN1**) used to control the functionality of CM4 apps. IPC Pipe is used to transfer the capsense response from CM0+ to CM4 core. For driving the graphics display emWin middleware library is used. SPI SD card is used for storing bitmap images that will be displayed in the graphics display. 

The code example includes the following two projects:

**proj_cm0p:** The proj_cm0p project, runs CAPSENSE&trade; on CM0+. This is the first project to start on every reset, and runs completely on the CM0+ CPU. It then boots the CM4 CPU. The CM0+ reads the Capsense buttons and send the response to CM4.

**proj_cm4:** This project is designed to run on the CM4 CPU. The project helps CM4 to drive graphics touch display and SD card.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[Kids_Learning_Kit_PSoC-62S4_Dual_Core_App](https://github.com/taifur20/Kids_Learning_Kit_PSoC-62S4_Dual_Core_App)" application with the  configured for the *CY8CKIT-62S4-Pioneer-Kit* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:


**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyCapsenseCM0p" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyCapsenseCM0p" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

## Operation

This example bundles two projects - the proj_cm0p project runs by CM0+ and the proj_cm4 project runs by CM4. The application can be built and programmed either from the top-level directory, or project-specific directory. In all cases, CM0+ and CM4 projects are built, and the resulting build artefacts are merged to contain code for both the projects. Do the following to run the program:

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Build and program the application using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program Application (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the user LED is glowing.
4. To test the application, touch CAPSENSE&trade; button 1 (**BTN1**) to turn the LED OFF, touch CAPSENSE&trade; button 0 (**BTN0**) to turn the LED ON and touch the slider in different positions to change the brightness.
5. You can also monitor the CAPSENSE&trade; data using the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application as follows:

### Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; tuner

1. Open CAPSENSE&trade; tuner from the IDE Quick Panel.
    
   You can also run the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application standalone from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file for the respective kit, which is present in the bsps/*TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>/config* folder.

2. Ensure that the kit is in KitProg3 mode. See [Firmware-loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch to KitProg3 mode.

3. In the tuner application, click **Tuner Communication Setup** or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window that appears, select the I2C checkbox under KitProg3 and configure as follows: 
   ```
   I2C address: 8
   Sub-address: 2 bytes
   Speed (kHz): 400
   ```

4. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect**.

5. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start**.

Under the **Widget View** tab, you can see the corresponding widgets highlighted in blue color when you touch the button or slider. You can also view the sensor data in the **Graph View** tab. For example, to view the sensor data for Button 0, select **Button0_Rx0** under **Button0**.

**Figure 1. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner showing touch data**

![](images/tuner_display.png)

CAPSENSE&trade; tuner can also be used for CAPSENSE&trade; parameter tuning and measuring signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). See the [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; tuner guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseTuner) (**Help** > **View Help**) and [AN85951 â€“ PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/an85951) for more details on selecting the tuning parameters.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This application has two projects - *proj_cm0p* and *proj_cm4*.

The linker script is modified to accommodate the *proj_cm0p* application on CM0+. If you wish to allocate more memory to *proj_cm0p*, follow the instructions from the "Customizing linker scripts" section in [AN215656](https://www.infineon.com/AN215656) â€“ *PSoC&trade; 6 MCU dual-CPU system design*.

When the application is built, it builds both the CM0+ and CM4 applications and the resulting build artifacts are merged to contain code for both the projects. When the CM0+ application is built, it will only build that application. When the application starts, the CM0+ starts first. It is responsible for starting the CM4.

In the CM0+ core, we make use of a self-capacitance (CSD) based 5-element CAPSENSE&trade; slider, and two mutual capacitance (CSX) CAPSENSE&trade; buttons for user input. The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; Middleware](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense) (see [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details on selecting a middleware). 

See [AN85951 â€“ PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage. 


In this application, the state of the user LED is controlled based on user inputs provided using the CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider. A PWM PDL resource is configured for controlling the brightness of the LED. Touching button 0 turns the LED ON, and button 1 turns the LED OFF. The brightness of the LED is set based on the touch position on the CAPSENSE&trade; slider. 

The [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) describes step-by-step instructions on how to configure CAPSENSE&trade; in the application. The CAPSENSE&trade; configurator and tuner tools can be launched from the CSD personality in the device configurator tool.

The application uses an [EZI2C PDL](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__scb__ezi2c.html) interface for communicating with the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner.

## Operation at custom power supply voltage

The application is configured to work with the default operating voltage of the kit.

**Table 1. Operating voltages supported by the kits**

| Kit                   | Supported operating voltages | Default operating voltage |

For kits that support multiple operating voltages, the default BSP configuration provided by the *design.modus* file should be customized. Follow the instructions to use the example at a custom power supply, such as 1.8 V:

1. Launch the [Device Configurator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig) tool using the Quick Panel link in the IDE. This opens the *design.modus* file from the  *bsps/TARGET_\<kit>/config* folder; and you are now free to customize the configuration as required.

2. Update the **Operating Conditions** parameters in power settings with the desired voltage and select **File** > **Save**.

   **Figure 2. Power settings to work with 1.8 V**
   
   ![](images/design_modus_custom_power_settings.png)

3. Change the jumper/switch setting as follows: 

   **Table 2. Jumper/switch position for 1.8 V operation**

   | Kit                   | Jumper/switch position |
   | :-------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | CY8CPROTO-062-4343W   | J3 (1-2)               |
   | CY8CKIT-062-BLE       | SW5 (1-2)              |
   | CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT   | SW5 (1-2)              |
   | CY8CKIT-062S2-43012   | J14 (1-2)              |
   | CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | J3 (1-2)               |
   | CY8CKIT-062S4         | J14 (1-2)              |
   | CY8CEVAL-062S2        | J14 (1-2)              |
   | CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 | J14 (1-2)          |
   | CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 | J14 (1-2)         |
